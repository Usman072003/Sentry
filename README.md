Project: SENTRY_SECURITY_CAMERA

Authors: Usman Naveed, Ahmad Baig

Project Status: In progress

For this project, my group and I are focused on creating a security camera called Sentry. We want To create the most attainable security with extensive mobility for users. The camera's hardware will include a Raspberry Pi as the main control 
unit, an SD card that will hold all the recorded footage and a good service motor that will go up, down, left, and right with 180-degree rotation. On the other hand, the user can control the camera in real-time through their phone and/or desktop
with our website. The user can activate modes such as sentry mode or manual control. The sentry mode will detect movement on the camera if it’s in its field of view.

Software/Hardware used:

Flask: This is a platform used for external devices through SSH to temporarily or permanently stream data to a domain located on your IP address. Our use for this software is to view our feed as we implement new code and also stream our feed 
through a custom domain that can be accessed from any IP address once established. 

Terminal: Since the Raspberry Pi is an external device connected through an IP address using an SSH connection, we must use Terminal as our main communication through my desktop to the device. We must use Terminal to transfer files, create files 
using the ‘nano’ command, and lastly run files. Once running they will continue to run through as long as connected to power and wifi. 

Python: this is the main language we are using as it is preferred by the external device the raspberryPi. 

HTML, CSS: This will be implemented once published in HTML.

Hardware: we are using multiple hardware components including servos, Raspberry Pi, and an Adafruit camera. We are still gathering some software to add further down the line once our project is fully operational, we have left room for improvements 
that we can come back to such as adding a microphone, and speakers, and as a gimmick feature, we might add a laser pointer.
